## Sub‑headline

At Mango Pomelo Labs, we explore the frontiers of fluid, context‑aware intelligence. We benchmark adaptability, develop self‑evolving agents, and architect guard‑rails to ensure advanced AI systems remain reliable, interpretable, and aligned with human values.

## Mission Statement

We believe the path to AGI isn’t just about scale—it’s about **flexibility** and **trustworthiness**. Our work spans dynamic benchmark design, test‑time adaptation methods, and meta‑learning loops that let models reshape themselves safely in new environments. By open‑sourcing our findings and collaborating with the broader AGI community, we aim to accelerate breakthroughs while embedding robustness and transparency at every step.

## Core Pillars

1. **Adaptive Benchmarks**  
   Holistic test suites that stress‑test an AI’s ability to pivot under domain shifts.

2. **Safe Meta‑Learning**  
   Layer‑wise token gating and self‑audit mechanisms to keep emergent behaviors in check.

3. **Open Collaboration**  
   Community‑driven datasets, challenge tracks, and reproducible pipelines.
